In the case that our app is built with Python, we have two popular choices for testing: unittest and pytest. I would choose unittest since it is already included in the Python standard library and easy to use. Linting would be done with Pylint. There are different build options based on the kind of Python application. There are the build and twine commands used to share packages via PyPI, and there are also tools to compile Python code such as cython. For our purposes, we will not build the application, but just run it on a server since it will be a back-end web app. For CI, there are many options, some of which include: Buddy, Bamboo CI, Travis CI, and Buildbot. Since this is a small team of 6, we would go with a cloud-based solution to save on hardware costs up front and to avoid having to manage and upgrade the server ourselves, instead taking advantage of professional support should any issues arise.
